EnkiLib
=========

Common library for EnkiGaming mods, not covering those mods dependent on EnkiCore.

This is the 1.8 port, which will be reflected back into the main project except for 1.8-specific code. Will be merged back into the original project when I update it to 1.8 and set 1.8 as the new minimum version for my mods.
